## Temporary GUI for HorusEye denoising presentation
Here we implement a temporary GUI for HorusEye. 
```
https://huggingface.co/spaces/Altoia/HorusEye
```
Feel free to upload a .dcm file with 512Ã—512 size and see the denoising results. Here we provide three visualization CT windows, as lung window ([-1000, 600]), the mediastinal window ([-200, 300]), and the abdomen window ([-160, 240]).

Note: The GUI is established based on the KAUST Ibex server. If there is any problem with the GUI due to the disconnection with the Ibex server, please email yuetan.chu@kaust.edu.sa. We will try to reconnect to the server or open a new address for the GUI.

We highly appreciate Dr. Jinwu Zhou and CHongxinan Pet Hospital, Hefei for providing the animal CT scans. We are grateful to the editors and the reviewers for their time and efforts spent on our paper. Their comments are very valuable for us to improve this work. We also thank the Computational Biological Research Center of KAUST for supporting the computational resources to run the experiments. We also thank Ana Bigio, scientific illustrator for helping us with the figure illustration.
